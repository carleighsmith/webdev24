                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p>It is toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
                    it positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport -
                    then it fixed in place.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box relative">
                
                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>Relative to its normal position.
                    we can apply properties like top, down , left, right.
                    These four(TDLR) properties causes it to be adjusted away from its original position.</p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="box fixed">
            
                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>It positioned relative to the VIEWPORT,( means it always stays in the same place during the scrolling).
                    Four properties are used to position the element.
                    this does not leave a gap in the page.</p>

            <div class="box absolute">
                
                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>It positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor(not same as fixed).But,
                    if it has no positioned ancestors, it moves along with page scrolling.</p>
