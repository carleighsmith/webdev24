<!--The Individual Case Project for each chapter in this 
    book will build on a website that you create on a subject
    of your choice. To begin, choose a topic for your website.
    This can be a topic related to your major, or a personal
    interest or activity. Plan a website containing at least
    four pages with a common layout and navigation system.
    Note that you’ll add pages to your site in later chapters,
    so ensure that your navigation system can support additional content. 
    Ensure that all of your web pages pass validation.-->
